# Record Collection

Your uncle heard you were a computer genius -- and he wants you to build him an app to catalog his awesome record collection. He'd really like to be able to check his stacks while he's at the record store and add any new purchases to his virtual library from his phone.

Here's what he wants the app to be able to do:
* Display all the artists whose records he has
* Display all the records he owns for each artist
* Add new records for existing artists
* Add new artists

He says you can start by including seven of his favorites:

You told him that this will literally take you an entire day, but he's very insistent. 

Fork and clone this repository, then let's build him a full-stack app using Express and MongoDB for the back end and JavaScript/jQuery for the front end!
