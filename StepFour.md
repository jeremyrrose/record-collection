# Record Collection: Step Four

At this point, you've built an entire API for [your uncle's record collection app](README.md). You *are* a computer genius, just like your grandma told him! You should be feeling pretty good about yourself.

But your uncle doesn't know much about REST APIs, and he'd like to be able to use this app on his phone from the record store -- so it's time to connect your API to a front end using jQuery!

## Get set up

So far, we've been doing our work on the API in the `/records-api` directory. Let's separate our front-end work into a different space we'll call `/client`:

```bash
cd ..
mkdir client
cd client
touch index.html style.css app.js
```

... to be continued!
